            My name is <b>Keerthi Mani.</b> I speak Tamil. I'm <em>32yrs</em> old. I was born and brought up in Tiruppur, India. I miss my parents and my country. I did my bachelors degree in <b>Civil Engineering, India.</b> I live in Bridgewater, NJ for about 8yrs. I'm a mother of two lovable and handsome boys. My husband is a Software Engineer and he works at Facebook. My interests are dancing, cooking, and painting. I love to ride bike with my kids. I teach canvas painting for kids at home.
